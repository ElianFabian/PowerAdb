Usage: logcat [OPTION]... [FILTERSPEC]...

General options:

-b BUFFER, --buffer=BUFFER
    Request alternate ring buffer(s). Options are:
        main system radio events crash default all
    Additionally, 'kernel' for userdebug and eng builds, and 'security' for
    Device Owner installations.
    Multiple -b parameters or comma separated list of buffers are
    allowed. Buffers are interleaved.
    Default is "main,system,crash,kernel".
-c, --clear
    Clear (flush) the entire log and exit. With -f, clear the specified file
    and its related rotated log files instead. With -L, clear pstore instead.
-d            Dump the log and then exit (don't block).
-L, --last    Dump logs from prior to last reboot from pstore.
--pid=PID     Only print logs from the given pid.
--wrap
    Sleep for 2 hours or until buffer about to wrap (whichever comes first).
    Improves efficiency of polling by providing an about-to-wrap wakeup.

Formatting:

-v, --format=FORMAT         Sets log print format. See FORMAT below.
-D, --dividers              Print dividers between each log buffer.
-B, --binary                Output the log in binary.
    --proto                 Output the log in protobuffer.

Output files:

-f, --file=FILE             Log to FILE instead of stdout.
-r, --rotate-kbytes=N       Rotate log every N KiB. Requires -f.
-n, --rotate-count=N        Sets max number of rotated logs, default 4.
--id=<id>
    Clears the associated files if the signature <id> for logging to file
    changes.

Logd control:

These options send a control message to the logd daemon on device, print its
return message if applicable, then exit. They are incompatible with -L
because these attributes do not apply to pstore.

-g, --buffer-size
    Get size of the ring buffers within logd.
-G, --buffer-size=SIZE
    Set size of a ring buffer in logd. May suffix with K or M.
    This can individually control each buffer's size with -b.
-p, --prune
    Get prune rules. Each rule is specified as UID, UID/PID or /PID. A
    '~' prefix indicates that elements matching the rule should be pruned
    with higher priority otherwise they're pruned with lower priority. All
    other pruning activity is oldest first. Special case ~! represents an
    automatic pruning for the noisiest UID as determined by the current
    statistics. Special case ~1000/! represents pruning of the worst PID
    within AID_SYSTEM when AID_SYSTEM is the noisiest UID.
-P, --prune='LIST ...'
    Set prune rules, using same format as listed above. Must be quoted.
-S, --statistics
    Output statistics. With --pid provides pid-specific stats.

Filtering:

-s                   Set default filter to silent (like filterspec '*:S').
-e, --regex=EXPR     Only print lines matching ECMAScript regex.
-m, --max-count=N    Exit after printing <count> lines.
--print              With --regex and --max-count, prints all messages
                     even if they do not match the regex, but exits after
                     printing max-count matching lines.
-t N                 Print most recent <count> lines (implies -d).
-T N                 Print most recent <count> lines (does not imply -d).
-t TIME              Print lines since specified time (implies -d).
-T TIME              Print lines since specified time (not imply -d).
                     Time format is 'MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mmm...',
                     'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mmm...', or 'sssss.mmm...'.
--uid=UIDS
    Only display log messages from UIDs in the comma-separated list UIDS.
    UIDs must be numeric because no name lookup is performed.
    Note that only root/log/system users can view logs from other users.

FILTERSPEC:

Filter specifications are a series of

  <tag>[:priority]

where <tag> is a log component tag (or * for all) and priority is:

  V    Verbose (default for <tag>)
  D    Debug (default for '*')
  I    Info
  W    Warn
  E    Error
  F    Fatal
  S    Silent (suppress all output)

'*' by itself means '*:D' and <tag> by itself means <tag>:V.
If no '*' filterspec or -s on command line, all filter defaults to '*:V'.
'*:S <tag>' prints only <tag>, '<tag>:S' suppresses all <tag> log messages.

If not specified on the command line, FILTERSPEC is $ANDROID_LOG_TAGS.

FORMAT:

Formats are a comma-separated sequence of verbs and adverbs.

Single format verbs:

  brief      Show priority, tag, and PID of the process issuing the message.
  long       Show all metadata fields and separate messages with blank lines.
  process    Show PID only.
  raw        Show the raw log message with no other metadata fields.
  tag        Show the priority and tag only.
  thread     Show priority, PID, and TID of the thread issuing the message.
  threadtime Show the date, invocation time, priority, tag, PID, and TID of
             the thread issuing the message. (This is the default.)
  time       Show the date, invocation time, priority, tag, and PID of the
             process issuing the message.

Adverb modifiers can be used in combination:

  color       Show each priority with a different color.
  descriptive Show event descriptions from event-log-tags database.
  epoch       Show time as seconds since 1970-01-01 (Unix epoch).
  monotonic   Show time as CPU seconds since boot.
  printable   Ensure that any binary logging content is escaped.
  uid         Show UID or Android ID of logged process (if permitted).
  usec        Show time with microsecond precision.
  UTC         Show time as UTC.
  year        Add the year to the displayed time.
  zone        Add the local timezone to the displayed time.
  \"<ZONE>\"  Print using this named timezone (experimental).

If not specified with -v on command line, FORMAT is $ANDROID_PRINTF_LOG or
defaults to "threadtime".
