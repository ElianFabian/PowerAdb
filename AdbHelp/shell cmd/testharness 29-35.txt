About:
  Test Harness Mode is a mode that the device can be placed in to prepare
  the device for running UI tests. The device is placed into this mode by
  first wiping all data from the device, preserving ADB keys.

  By default, the following settings are configured:
    * Package Verifier is disabled
    * Stay Awake While Charging is enabled
    * OTA Updates are disabled
    * Auto-Sync for accounts is disabled

  Other apps may configure themselves differently in Test Harness Mode by
  checking ActivityManager.isRunningInUserTestHarness()

Test Harness Mode commands:
  help
    Print this help text.

  enable|restore
    Erase all data from this device and enable Test Harness Mode,
    preserving the stored ADB keys currently on the device and toggling
    settings in a way that are conducive to Instrumentation testing.
