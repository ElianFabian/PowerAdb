Location Time Zone Manager (location_time_zone_manager) commands for tests:
  help
    Print this help text.
  start
    Starts the service, creating location time zone providers.
  stop
    Stops the service, destroying location time zone providers.
  record_provider_states (true|false)
    Enables / disables provider state recording mode. See also dump_state. The default state is always "false".
    Note: When enabled, this mode consumes memory and it is only intended for testing.
    It should be disabled after use, or the device can be rebooted to reset the mode to disabled.
    Disabling (or enabling repeatedly) clears any existing stored states.
  dump_state [--proto]
    Dumps service state for tests as text or binary proto form.
    See the LocationTimeZoneManagerServiceStateProto definition for details.
  send_provider_test_command <provider index> <test command>
    Passes a test command to the named provider.

<provider index> = 0 (primary), 1 (secondary)

send_provider_test_command details:

Provider <test command> encoding:

Test commands are encoded on the command line as: <name> <arg>*

The <name> is a string
The <arg> encoding is: "key=type:value"

e.g. "myKey=string:myValue" represents an argument with the key "myKey" and a string value of "myValue"
Values are one or more URI-encoded strings separated by & characters. Only some types support multiple values, e.g. string arrays.

Recognized types are: string, boolean, double, long, string_array.

When passing test commands via adb shell, the & can be escaped by quoting the <arg> and escaping the & with \
For example:
  $ adb shell ... my-command "key1=string_array:value1\&value2"

Simulated provider mode can be used to test the system server behavior or to reproduce bugs without the complexity of using real providers.

The test commands for simulated providers are:
on_bind
on_unbind
perm_fail
uncertain
success tz=string_array:<time zone id>[&<time zone id>]+

Test commands cannot currently be passed to real provider implementations.

This service is also affected by the following device_config flags in the system_time namespace:
  primary_location_time_zone_provider_mode_override
    Overrides the mode of the primary provider. Values=disabled|enabled|simulated
  secondary_location_time_zone_provider_mode_override
    Overrides the mode of the secondary provider. Values=disabled|enabled|simulated
  location_time_zone_detection_uncertainty_delay_millis
    Sets the amount of time the service waits when uncertain before making an 'uncertain' suggestion to the time zone detector.
  ltpz_init_timeout_millis
    Sets the initialization time passed to the providers.
  ltpz_init_timeout_fuzz_millis
    Sets the amount of extra time added to the providers' initialization time.

Typically, use 'stop' to stop the service before setting individual flags and 'start' after to restart it.

See "adb shell cmd device_config" for more information on setting flags.

Also see "adb shell cmd time_zone_detector help" for higher-level location time zone commands / settings.
