  run [-f | --force] [-s | --satisfied] [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Trigger immediate execution of a specific scheduled job. For historical
    reasons, some constraints, such as battery, are ignored when this
    command is called. If you don't want any constraints to be ignored,
    include the -s flag.
    Options:
      -f or --force: run the job even if technical constraints such as
         connectivity are not currently met. This is incompatible with -f
         and so an error will be reported if both are given.
      -n or --namespace: specify the namespace this job sits in; the default
         is null (no namespace).
      -s or --satisfied: run the job only if all constraints are met.
         This is incompatible with -f and so an error will be reported
         if both are given.
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
  stop [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] [-s | --stop-reason STOP_REASON] [-i | --internal-stop-reason STOP_REASON] [PACKAGE] [JOB_ID]
    Trigger immediate stop of currently executing jobs using the specified
    stop reasons.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         all users
      -n or --namespace: specify the namespace this job sits in; the default
         is null (no namespace).
      -s or --stop-reason: specify the stop reason given to the job.
         Valid values are those that can be returned from
         JobParameters.getStopReason().
          The default value is STOP_REASON_USER.
      -i or --internal-stop-reason: specify the internal stop reason.
         JobScheduler will use for internal processing.
         Valid values are those that can be returned from
         JobParameters.getInternalStopReason().
          The default value is INTERNAL_STOP_REASON_UNDEFINED.
  timeout [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] [PACKAGE] [JOB_ID]
    Trigger immediate timeout of currently executing jobs, as if their
    execution timeout had expired.
    This is the equivalent of calling `stop -s 3 -i 3`.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         all users
      -n or --namespace: specify the namespace this job sits in; the default
         is null (no namespace).
  cancel [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE [JOB_ID]
    Cancel a scheduled job.  If a job ID is not supplied, all jobs scheduled
    by that package will be canceled.  USE WITH CAUTION.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
      -n or --namespace: specify the namespace this job sits in; the default
         is null (no namespace).
  heartbeat [num]
    No longer used.
  monitor-battery [on|off]
    Control monitoring of all battery changes.  Off by default.  Turning
    on makes get-battery-seq useful.
  get-battery-seq
    Return the last battery update sequence number that was received.
  get-battery-charging
    Return whether the battery is currently considered to be charging.
  get-battery-not-low
    Return whether the battery is currently considered to not be low.
  get-estimated-download-bytes [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Return the most recent estimated download bytes for the job.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
  get-estimated-upload-bytes [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Return the most recent estimated upload bytes for the job.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
  get-storage-seq
    Return the last storage update sequence number that was received.
  get-storage-not-low
    Return whether storage is currently considered to not be low.
  get-transferred-download-bytes [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Return the most recent transferred download bytes for the job.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
  get-transferred-upload-bytes [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Return the most recent transferred upload bytes for the job.
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
  get-job-state [-u | --user USER_ID] [-n | --namespace NAMESPACE] PACKAGE JOB_ID
    Return the current state of a job, may be any combination of:
      pending: currently on the pending list, waiting to be active
      active: job is actively running
      user-stopped: job can't run because its user is stopped
      backing-up: job can't run because app is currently backing up its data
      no-component: job can't run because its component is not available
      ready: job is ready to run (all constraints satisfied or bypassed)
      waiting: if nothing else above is printed, job not ready to run
    Options:
      -u or --user: specify which user's job is to be run; the default is
         the primary or system user
      -n or --namespace: specify the namespace this job sits in; the default
