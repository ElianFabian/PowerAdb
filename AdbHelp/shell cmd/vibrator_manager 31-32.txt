  help
    Prints this help text.

  list
    Prints the id of device vibrators. This does not include any
    connected input device.
  synced [options] <effect>...
    Vibrates effect on all vibrators in sync.
  combined [options] (-v <vibrator-id> <effect>...)...
    Vibrates different effects on each vibrator in sync.
  sequential [options] (-v <vibrator-id> <effect>...)...
    Vibrates different effects on each vibrator in sequence.
  cancel
    Cancels any active vibration

Effect commands:
  oneshot [-w delay] [-a] <duration> [<amplitude>]
    Vibrates for duration milliseconds; ignored when device is on
    DND (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength user setting
    will be used to scale amplitude.
    If -w is provided, the effect will be played after the specified
    wait time in milliseconds.
    If -a is provided, the command accepts a second argument for
    amplitude, in a scale of 1-255.
  waveform [-w delay] [-r index] [-a] [-f] [-c] (<duration> [<amplitude>] [<frequency>])...
    Vibrates for durations and amplitudes in list; ignored when
    device is on DND (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength
    user setting will be used to scale amplitude.
    If -w is provided, the effect will be played after the specified
    wait time in milliseconds.
    If -r is provided, the waveform loops back to the specified
    index (e.g. 0 loops from the beginning)
    If -a is provided, the command expects amplitude to follow each
    duration; otherwise, it accepts durations only and alternates
    off/on
    If -f is provided, the command expects frequency to follow each
    amplitude or duration; otherwise, it uses resonant frequency
    If -c is provided, the waveform is continuous and will ramp
    between values; otherwise each entry is a fixed step.
    Duration is in milliseconds; amplitude is a scale of 1-255;
    frequency is a relative value around resonant frequency 0;
  prebaked [-w delay] [-b] <effect-id>
    Vibrates with prebaked effect; ignored when device is on DND
    (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength user setting
    will be used to scale amplitude.
    If -w is provided, the effect will be played after the specified
    wait time in milliseconds.
    If -b is provided, the prebaked fallback effect will be played if
    the device doesn't support the given effect-id.
  primitives ([-w delay] <primitive-id>)...
    Vibrates with a composed effect; ignored when device is on DND
    (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength user setting
    will be used to scale primitive intensities.
    If -w is provided, the next primitive will be played after the
    specified wait time in milliseconds.

Common Options:
  -f
    Force. Ignore Do Not Disturb setting.
  -d <description>
    Add description to the vibration.
