  simulate-device-appeared ASSOCIATION_ID
      Make CDM act as if the given companion device has appeared.
      I.e. bind the associated companion application's
      CompanionDeviceService(s) and trigger onDeviceAppeared() callback.
      The CDM will consider the devices as present for 60 seconds and then
      will act as if device disappeared, unless 'simulate-device-disappeared'
      or 'simulate-device-appeared' is called again before 60 seconds run out.

      I.e. unbind the associated companion application's
      CompanionDeviceService(s) and trigger onDeviceDisappeared() callback.
      NOTE: This will only have effect if 'simulate-device-appeared' was
      invoked for the same device (same ASSOCIATION_ID) no longer than
      60 seconds ago.
