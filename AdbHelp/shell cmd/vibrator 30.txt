  vibrate duration [description]
    Vibrates for duration milliseconds; ignored when device is on
    DND (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength user setting
    will be used to scale amplitude.
  waveform [-d description] [-r index] [-a] duration [amplitude] ...
    Vibrates for durations and amplitudes in list; ignored when
    device is on DND (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength
    user setting will be used to scale amplitude.
    If -r is provided, the waveform loops back to the specified
    index (e.g. 0 loops from the beginning)
    If -a is provided, the command accepts duration-amplitude pairs;
    otherwise, it accepts durations only and alternates off/on
    Duration is in milliseconds; amplitude is a scale of 1-255.
  prebaked [-b] effect-id [description]
    Vibrates with prebaked effect; ignored when device is on DND
    (Do Not Disturb) mode; touch feedback strength user setting
    will be used to scale amplitude.
    If -b is provided, the prebaked fallback effect will be played if
    the device doesn't support the given effect-id.
