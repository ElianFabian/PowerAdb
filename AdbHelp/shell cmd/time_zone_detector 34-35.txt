Time Zone Detector (time_zone_detector) commands:
  help
    Print this help text.
  is_auto_detection_enabled
    Prints true/false according to the automatic time zone detection setting
  set_auto_detection_enabled true|false
    Sets the automatic time zone detection setting.
  is_telephony_detection_supported
    Prints true/false according to whether telephony time zone detection is supported on this device.
  is_geo_detection_supported
    Prints true/false according to whether geolocation time zone detection is supported on this device.
  is_geo_detection_enabled
    Prints true/false according to the geolocation time zone detection setting.
  set_geo_detection_enabled true|false
    Sets the geolocation time zone detection enabled setting.
  enable_telephony_fallback
    Signals that telephony time zone detection fall back can be used if geolocation detection is supported and enabled.
)    This is a temporary state until geolocation detection becomes "certain".
    To have an effect this requires that the telephony fallback feature is supported on the device, see below for device_config flags.
  handle_location_algorithm_event <location event opts>
    Simulates an event from the location time zone detection algorithm.
  suggest_manual_time_zone <manual suggestion opts>
    Suggests a time zone as if supplied by a user manually.
  suggest_telephony_time_zone <telephony suggestion opts>
    Simulates a time zone suggestion from the telephony time zone detection algorithm.
  get_time_zone_state
    Returns the current time zone setting state.
  set_time_zone_state_for_tests <time zone state options>
    Sets the current time zone state for tests.
  confirm_time_zone <--zone_id Olson ID>
    Tries to confirms the time zone, raising the confidence.
  dump_metrics
    Dumps the service metrics to stdout for inspection.

Location algorithm event options:
  --status {LocationTimeZoneAlgorithmStatus toString() format}
  [--suggestion {UNCERTAIN|EMPTY|<Olson ID>+}]

See com.android.server.timezonedetector.LocationAlgorithmEvent for more information

Manual suggestion options:
  --zone_id <Olson ID>

See android.app.timezonedetector.ManualTimeZoneSuggestion for more information

Telephony suggestion options:
  --slot_index <number>
  To withdraw a previous suggestion:
    [--zone_id "_"]
  To make a new suggestion:
    --zone_id <Olson ID>
    --quality <single|multiple_same|multiple_different>
    --match_type <emulator|country_with_offset|country|test_network>

See android.app.timezonedetector.TelephonyTimeZoneSuggestion for more information

TimeZoneState options:
  --zone_id {<Olson ID>}
  --user_should_confirm_id {true|false}

See android.app.time.TimeZoneState for more information

This service is also affected by the following device_config flags in the system_time namespace:
  location_time_zone_detection_feature_supported
    Only observed if the geolocation time zone detection feature is enabled in config.
    Set this to false to disable the feature.
  location_time_zone_detection_run_in_background_enabled
    Runs geolocation time zone detection even when it not enabled by the user. The result is not used to set the device's time zone [*]
  location_time_zone_detection_setting_enabled_default
    Only used if the device does not have an explicit 'geolocation time zone detection enabled' setting stored [*].
    The default is when unset is false.
  location_time_zone_detection_setting_enabled_override
    Used to override the device's 'geolocation time zone detection enabled' setting [*].
  time_zone_detector_auto_detection_enabled_default
    Used to set the automatic time zone detection enabled default, i.e. when the device's automatic time zone detection enabled setting hasn't been set explicitly. Intended for internal testers.  time_zone_detector_telephony_fallback_supported
    Used to enable / disable support for telephony detection fallback. Also see the enable_telephony_fallback command.
  enhanced_metrics_collection_enabled
    Used to increase the detail of metrics collected / reported.

[*] To be enabled, the user must still have location = on / auto time zone detection = on.

See "adb shell cmd device_config" for more information on setting flags.

Also see "adb shell cmd location_time_zone_manager help" for lower-level location time zone commands / settings.
