Attention commands:
  setTestableAttentionService <service_package>: Bind to a custom implementation of attention service
  ---<service_package>:
       := Package containing the Attention Service implementation to bind to
  ---returns:
       := true, if was bound successfully
       := false, if was not bound successfully
  clearTestableAttentionService: Undo custom bindings. Revert to previous behavior
  getAttentionServiceComponent: Get the current service component string
  ---returns:
       := If valid, the component string (in shorten form) for the currently bound service.
       := else, empty string
  call checkAttention: Calls check attention
  ---returns:
       := true, if the call was successfully dispatched to the service implementation. (to see the result, call getLastTestCallbackCode)
       := false, otherwise
  call cancelCheckAttention: Cancels check attention
  call onStartProximityUpdates: Calls onStartProximityUpdates
  ---returns:
       := true, if the request was successfully dispatched to the service implementation. (to see the result, call getLastTestProximityUpdateCallbackCode)
       := false, otherwise
  call onStopProximityUpdates: Cancels proximity updates
  getLastTestCallbackCode
  ---returns:
       := An integer, representing the last callback code received from the bounded implementation. If none, it will return -1
  getLastTestProximityUpdateCallbackCode
  ---returns:
       := A double, representing the last proximity value received from the bounded implementation. If none, it will return -1.0
