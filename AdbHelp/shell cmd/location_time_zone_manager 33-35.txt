  start
    Starts the service, creating location time zone providers.
  start_with_test_providers <primary package name|@null> <secondary package name|@null> <record states>

This service is also affected by the following device_config flags in the system_time namespace:
  primary_location_time_zone_provider_mode_override
    Overrides the mode of the primary provider. Values=disabled|enabled
  secondary_location_time_zone_provider_mode_override
    Overrides the mode of the secondary provider. Values=disabled|enabled
  location_time_zone_detection_uncertainty_delay_millis
    Sets the amount of time the service waits when uncertain before making an 'uncertain' suggestion to the time zone detector.
  ltzp_init_timeout_millis
    Sets the initialization time passed to the providers.
  ltzp_init_timeout_fuzz_millis
    Sets the amount of extra time added to the providers' initialization time.
  ltzp_event_filtering_age_threshold_millis
    Sets the amount of time that must pass between equivalent LTZP events before they will be reported to the system server.

Typically, use 'stop' to stop the service before setting individual flags and 'start' after to restart it.

See "adb shell cmd device_config" for more information on setting flags.

Also see "adb shell cmd time_zone_detector help" for higher-level location time zone commands / settings.
