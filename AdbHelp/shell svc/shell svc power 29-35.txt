Control the power manager

usage: svc power stayon [true|false|usb|ac|wireless]
         Set the 'keep awake while plugged in' setting.
       svc power reboot [reason]
         Perform a runtime shutdown and reboot device with specified reason.
       svc power shutdown
         Perform a runtime shutdown and power off the device.
       svc power forcesuspend [t]
         Force the system into suspend, ignoring all wakelocks.
         t - Number of milliseconds to wait before issuing force-suspend.
             Helps with devices that can't suspend while plugged in.
             Defaults to 0.
             When using a delay, you must use the nohup shell modifier:
             'adb shell nohup svc power forcesuspend [time]'
         Use caution; this is dangerous. It puts the device to sleep
         immediately without giving apps or the system an opportunity to
         save their state.
