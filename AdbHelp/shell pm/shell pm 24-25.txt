NOTE: 'pm list' commands have moved! Run 'adb shell cmd package'
  to display the new commands.

pm path: print the path to the .apk of the given PACKAGE.

pm dump: print system state associated with the given PACKAGE.

pm install: install a single legacy package
pm install-create: create an install session
    -l: forward lock application
    -r: replace existing application
    -t: allow test packages
    -i: specify the installer package name
    -s: install application on sdcard
    -f: install application on internal flash
    -d: allow version code downgrade (debuggable packages only)
    -p: partial application install
    -g: grant all runtime permissions
    -S: size in bytes of entire session

pm install-write: write a package into existing session; path may
  be '-' to read from stdin
    -S: size in bytes of package, required for stdin

pm install-commit: perform install of fully staged session
pm install-abandon: abandon session

pm set-installer: set installer package name

pm uninstall: removes a package from the system. Options:
    -k: keep the data and cache directories around after package removal.

pm enable, disable, disable-user, disable-until-used, default-state:
  these commands change the enabled state of a given package or
  component (written as "package/class").

pm grant, revoke: these commands either grant or revoke permissions

    manifest, be runtime permissions (protection level dangerous),
    and the app targeting SDK greater than Lollipop MR1.

pm reset-permissions: revert all runtime permissions to their default state.

pm get-install-location: returns the current install location.
    0 [auto]: Let system decide the best location
    1 [internal]: Install on internal device storage
    2 [external]: Install on external media

pm set-install-location: changes the default install location.
  NOTE: this is only intended for debugging; using this can cause
  applications to break and other undersireable behavior.
    0 [auto]: Let system decide the best location
    1 [internal]: Install on internal device storage
    2 [external]: Install on external media

pm trim-caches: trim cache files to reach the given free space.

pm create-user: create a new user with the given USER_NAME,
  printing the new user identifier of the user.

pm remove-user: remove the user with the given USER_IDENTIFIER,
  deleting all data associated with that user
